# UnderB
A very silly parody of a game called [Undertale](http://undertale.com/), created as a learning experience.

Goals for this project:
 * Very identical text box system.
 * Similar turn-based RPG battle system.
 * A silly story to go along with the game.
 * A stable game in general.

**90% of the sprites and music/sounds in this game are ripped from Undertale**, so credit to Toby Fox, Temmie Chang, and the other artists of Undertale. **Toby Fox has stated that he has no problem with me using the assets as long as it's kept here as was originally intended, as a learning experience.** I have no intention of claiming these as my own, and I will not be selling this game for any amount of money or for free. It's just a fun project to help me learn both basic and advanced concepts in GMS.

_If you're the creator of any content in this project and you would like me to take it down, just let me know and I will comply._
